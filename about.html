    <p id="siteDescription"> superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and 
        has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, you need a 
        power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess, and you need to use that power 
        to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. For instance, a good guy 
        fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy 
        with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal 
        human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.
