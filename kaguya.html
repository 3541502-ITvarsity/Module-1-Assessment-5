            <p id="siteDescription">"Kaguya Ōtsutsuki (大筒木 カグヤ, Ōtsutsuki Kaguya) is a member of the main family of the Ōtsutsuki clan who is the central underlying antagonist of the Naruto series. Unlike her kinsmen, Kaguya decided to keep 
                the world to herself after eating a fruit from the Divine Tree on that world, becoming a part of the tree while using it and the Rinne Sharigan to subject the world to the Infinite Tsukuyomi to end all conflict.[ch. 646] While Kaguya was 
                revered as the "Rabbit Goddess" (卯の女神, Usagi no Megami), Kaguya was consumed by her power as eventually lost trust in humanity while converting humans assimilated by the Divine Tree into her personal army of White Zetsu as a defense 
                against her kinsmen. This and the other horrifying acts that Kaguya resulted in the then-powerless people to denounce her as a "Demon" (鬼, Oni). Later learning that some of her chakra passed on into her sons, Hagoromo and Hamura, Kaguya 
                attempts to reclaim that power by merging into the Divine Tree and transforming it into the Ten-Tails (十尾, Jūbi). But the battle that follow resulted in the Ten-Tails being sealed within the moon when captured by Hagoromo and reduced to the corpse-like Gedo Statue."

                Many may argue that the goddess Kaguya is not superhero but a villian.judjing from the fact that A superhero or superheroine is a stock character that possesses abilities beyond those of ordinary people, who typically uses his or her powers to help the world become a 
                better place, or is dedicated to protecting the public, and fighting crime.And knowing that Kaguya was once a humble soul until humans betrayed her and yet she didnt destroy the human race even though she had the power and motive but chose to save them for the sake of her sons who later on betrayed her also.
                Even after obtaining some of her power which is enough to destroy the world she still chooses to continue with oproject tsukunomi which is  a peaceful dream where no one feels any pain,the dead are revived and no one has a motive for evil, that should be enough to give us a right to put a hero in the <b>hero</b>in.
