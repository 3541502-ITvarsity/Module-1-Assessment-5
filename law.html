            <p id="siteDescription">The "Surgeon of Death" (死の外科医, Shi no Gekai), Trafalgar D. Water Law (トラファルガー・D・ワーテル・ロー, Torafarugā Dī Wāteru Rō), originates from the North Blue.[ch. 498, 508, 578, 763] Having eaten the Op-Op Fruit (オペオペの実, Ope Ope no Mi), Law can, within a spherical area around himself,
                 cut and teleport objects as well as perform body swaps.[ch. 661] He is the captain of the Heart Pirates (ハートの海賊団, Hāto no Kaizokudan), consisting of twenty-one members, including the polar bear mink and crew's navigator Bepo (ベポ, Bepo), Shachi (シャチ, Shachi), Penguin (ペンギン, Pengin), and the former slave 
                 Jean Bart (ジャンバール, Janbāru). Originally a member of the Don Quixote Pirates, Law makes a name for himself and, following the Paramount War, joins the Seven Warlords of the Sea.[ch. 659, 673] Though he enters into an alliance with Luffy and the Straw Hats to take down Kaido, one of the Four Emperors, Law is 
                 actually hunting down Don Quixote Doflamingo.

                In the anime series, his voice actor is Hiroshi Kamiya.[45] In the Funimation English adaptation, his voice actor is Matthew Mercer.
